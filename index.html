    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
    <br>
        <ul>
            <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
            <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
            <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p id ="centered-paragraph">&lt;The first player to score 100 or more points wins.&gt;</p>
        <br>    
        <p id="example-paragraph">For example, the first player, Chris, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Chris could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Chris rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Chris rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alex, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 23 points to his score.</p>
